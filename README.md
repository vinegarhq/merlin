Merlin is a telemetry endpoint developed for a 1 week collection of statistics from users.
It includes:
 - Customizable telemetry endpoint to record JSONs from POSTs
 - Generation of CSVs for use in R and other data analysis tools
 - HTTPS support

This was created with the objective of answering the questions:
 - How large is ROL / Vinegar userbase? (limited to who opts in, obviously)
 - What is the oldest processor supported?
 - Is AVX truly a requirement?
